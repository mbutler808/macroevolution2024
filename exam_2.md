# Zool 719 Macroevolution
# Exam 2
## Due: April 5, 2024 at 5pm.

### Instructions  
Please answer the questions directly, your grade will be influenced by the strength of your argument, including clarity of your points and support with evidence from the readings or related readings. 

Please write your answers by hand, and please try to be concise. That is, directly answer the questions, providing specific examples as necessary to support your statement. No fluff. (As a rough guide, less than 2 college-ruled pages per question). Please answer three of the four questions.  

### Questions  
1. What are the roles of development and genetic architecture on the mapping of genotype to phenotype? In your answer, compare the views of Hansen, Carroll, and Wagner and Altenberg (you may include additional readings if you feel inspired). Does development take precedence over genetic architecture, or vice versa, or neither? What is the role of cyclical networks? What implications/relationships are there with the concepts of modularity? evolvability? stability?  

2. Why is phylogenetic reconstruction (including resolution of character polarity and homology) necessary for studying adaptation (as conceived by Gould and Vrba) and heterochronic evolution? How could erroneous character polarity produce mistaken conclusions regarding the evolutionary occurrence of adaptation and the different hetercrhonic patterns and processes identified by Alberch, Gould, Oster, and Wake? 

3. Wagner (1988) claims that developmental constraints were traditionally viewed as playing a negative role in the mechanisms of adaptation, but proposes that constraints may actually play a positive role in generating diversity. Please contrast these views and explain how the origin of individuality and hierarchy may aid in generating morphological diversity. Illustrate these conceptual ideas via the molecular mechanisms discussed in more recent work on genetic architecture and evo-devo. Are these ideas more in line with internalist (order based on the internal dynamics of development) or externalist (based on natural selection on the organism-environment interaction) views on the evolution of morphology? How can these ideas support (or refute) Simpson ªs conceptual model of "quantum evolution" and adaptive diversification? 

4. The neo Darwinian view of atomism is that structures are free to vary in any direction, and that selection can act on any of these to result in the evolution of any form. One criticsm of neo Darwinism is the difficulty of explaining complex adaptations and how they arise. Explain how the views of evolutionary developmental biolgists overcome these difficulties. What is the relationship between homologues, modules, and regulatory networks, and their role in the evolution of complex adaptations? Why is modularity such a deep concept to both evolution and development?
