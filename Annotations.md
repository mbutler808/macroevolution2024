Reading Guide to Papers by Allan Larson

I. Darwinism and Macroevolution

	1. Mayr, E. (1982) - the philosophical foundations of biological science discussed by a major contributor to the evolutionary synthesis. Mayr's emphasis on quality of concepts and theory as the measure of a science is central to this course. This assignment introduces hypothetico-deductivism, comparative methodology, essentialism versus populational thinking, hierarchy, and reductionism, all of which are major themes of macroevolution. This is the best concise coverage of these issues that I know.

	2. Mayr, E. (1985) - the best summary that I know of the major components of Darwinian evolutionary theory as synthesized in the mid twentieth century by Mayr and others. The subsequent history of macroevolution consists largely of controversies concerning whether and how these principles provide a complete and satisfactory foundation for macroevolutionary studies.

	3. Gould, S. J. (1995) - argues that a hierarchically expanded evolutionary theory is needed to accommodate the study of macroevolutionary phenomena. This theory is a direct challenge to the utility of gradualism and natural selection as presented in reading #3, although it accepts the other major components of Darwinism. A major focus of this class is to ask whether traditional Darwinism or a hierarchically expanded theory as advocated here should guide macroevolutionary study.

	4. Simpson, G. G. (1944) - excerpts from a classic work by the paleontologist credited with bringing paleontology and systematics into the Darwinian evolutionary synthesis and discrediting formerly popular theories of orthogenesis and neo-Lamarckism. Stephen Jay Gould adopts Simpson's conceptual framework for the role of paleontology in evolutionary studies, but he challenges Simpson's substantive conclusions. Note especially Simpson's categorization of evolutionary modes and tempos, and how studies of fossils are intended to use measurements of tempo to infer mode.


II. Construction of Higher Taxa

A. Evolutionary Taxonomy

	5. Simpson, G. G. (1953) - excerpts from an updated, expanded and retitled version of the book from Simpson (1944). The strong presence of adaptationist principles in constructing higher taxonomic categories and evaluating their evolutionary origins should be noted, especially the concept of adaptive zone. This adaptationist focus has been criticized by some evolutionists, causing them to prefer the earlier book, which is considered more pluralistic. Simpson's "evolutionary taxonomy" as presented here guided most macroevolutionary study in the latter twentieth century and continues to do so in evolutionary paleontology. Cladistic criticism of it is severe, as subsequent readings show.

	6. Mayr, E. (1982) - a concise summary and defense of evolutionary taxonomy following challenges by pheneticists and cladists. Note Mayr's defense of the important concept of "grade."

	7. Miller, A. H. (1949) - an excellent example of evolutionary analysis of the origin of a higher taxonomic category (genus) following Simpsonian principles. This is perhaps the first use of the term "key innovation" (also termed key adaptation, key invention, and key character by various authors), which remains influential and appears in later topics. This kind of study later would be severely criticized by cladistic systematists.

B. Phenetic versus Cladistic Taxonomy

	8. Sneath, P. H. A. and R. R. Sokal (1973) - excerpts from the classic work (updated version) of phenetic taxonomy, a modernist challenge to Simpsonian principles. Quantitative measurement and computation are given priority over evolutionary principles in constructing higher taxa. These excerpts give excellent definitions of important terms and the main arguments for a taxonomic system that is now largely discredited. It is perhaps the best example of how emphasis on "practicality," quantification and computation without conceptual integrity produces unsatisfactory science.

	9. de Queiroz, K. (1988) - a strong statement of the philosophical foundations of phylogenetic systematics (cladistics). Note especially the argument that the "evolutionary taxonomy" of Mayr and Simpson fails to serve Darwinian principles because it only puts an evolutionary veneer on an essentialistic taxonomic system. Cladistic critics (especially Michael Ghiselin) use this argument to call Mayr an essentialist, knowing how much this claim upset him (compare these statements to Mayr's comments on essentialism in reading #1).


	10. Eldredge, N. and J. Cracraft. (1980) - 



IV. Evolutionary Morphology

A. Taxic Homology

	11. Patterson, C. (1982) - This is the most influential writing on the subject of taxic homology since a rebirth of interest in morphological characters and homology in the early 1980s. Patterson's review of the three tests of homology and how they distinguish homology from alternative relationships among characters is extensively used and cited. His decision to equate homology with synapomorphy remains controversial. The important theme of ontogeny and phylogeny as introduced here is a major theme of the course. This paper is also an argument for a taxonomic philosophy called "pattern cladism," which denies the claim that evolutionary theory should be the basis of phylogenetic systematics. Patterson builds his argument for pattern cladism from Karl Popper's philosophical principles of hypothetico-deductivism, which he abuses (see reading #12). This paper and the next one are among the most tedious ones in the course; working through them is useful, however, for getting a thorough understanding of morphological homology. Patterson's tests are also the basis for distinguishing different kinds of molecular homology.

	12. de Queiroz, K. (1985) - a critique of pattern cladism showing the conceptual problems of Patterson's scheme. I agree with this criticism and with the argument that phylogenetic systematics should be based explicitly on Darwin's theory of common descent. The novel character concept presented here is insightful, although few morphological systematists have implemented it (not even the author). This paper, like #11, is tedious reading but provides a thorough understanding of morphological characters in systematics and the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny. Its insights reward a careful reading.

B. Transformational Homology

	13. Kaplan, D. R. (1984) - an excellent illustration of using ontogenetic and temporal series to test hypotheses of homology among characters. It counters Patterson's argument that transformational concepts of homology are untestable. It can be viewed as an elaboration of methods for implementing Patterson's "similarity test." The formal terminology proposed regarding homology and related concepts has not been influential and should be discarded.

	14. Wagner, G. P. (1989) - Wagner's writings on homology have been critical in forming a synthesis of developmental biology and evolutionary biology. Of his various papers on homology, this one is still my favorite general overview. Pay close attention to the three fundamental properties of biological homology. How does Wagner's approach to homology differ from Patterson's?

	15. Roth, V. L. (1991) - my favorite paper on the hierarchical expansion of the concept of homology. It shows to my satisfaction how a character can be a valid homology in theory but still fail Patterson's congruence test. This is the phenomenon recognized in molecular evolution as "lineage sorting," derived here in a general sense. "Genetic piracy" of homologies is another important concept central to understanding the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny.

	16. Wagner, G. P. (2007) - further exploration of the hierarchical structure of homology, including the relationship between morphological homology and the structures of genetic systems. Pay close attention to the meanings of character identity networks (ChINs) and gene regulatory networks (GRNs).

C. Heterochrony, Heterotopy and Ontogenetic Repatterning

	17. Alberch, P., S. J. Gould, G. F. Oster and D. B. Wake (1979) - a classic paper giving formal definitions of the standard patterns and processes of heterochrony, especially as relevant to changes occurring relatively late in ontogeny (retroactively termed "de Beerian heterochrony" by many authors). This is the standard scheme against which others are compared.

	18. Raff, R. A. and G. A. Wray (1989) - an important paper showing that the standard categorization of heterochronic patterns and processes (reading #32) is difficult to apply to early ontogeny and/or between hierarchical levels (organismal morphology versus gene expression).

	19. West-Eberhard, M. J. (2003) - Heterotopy, including the phenomenon of homoeosis, received less general discussion in the evolutionary literature than did heterochrony in the early history of evolutionary developmental biology, although it has acquired equal or greater importance in explaining origins of new characters. This is a good explanation of the most common usage of heterotopy and how it contrasts with heterochrony.

	20. Webster, M. and M. L. Zelditch (2005) - perhaps the finest-level distinction of concepts pertaining to different kinds of changes to ontogeny and how they lead to ontogenetic repatterning. I find the authors arguments convincing, but the revised terminology is complex and not yet widely in use.

D. Developmental Constraints and Evolution

	21. Pattee, H. H. (1973) - the work of a theoretical physicist who studies the origin of life and its hierarchical structure. It is an abstract paper with statements generalized to origins of individuality at any hierarchical interface. Evolution of new homologies through developmental synorganization is one example; evolution of new species through mate recognition systems is another one. Understanding this general model clarifies many macroevolutionary issues as instances of the origin of collective control constraints by a group of elements (cells, morphological structures, organisms). This is the general theory underlying evolution of individuality.

	22. Alberch, P. (1989) - a relatively late but well illustrated paper in Alberch's structurtalist/internalist critique of Darwinian evolutionary theory. His main goal is to understand how properties of development bias the production of variation and thereby channel the directions of morphological evolution. Attention to "developmental constraint" in evolution originated in these writings.

	23. Wagner, G. P. (1988) - the first paper to show that developmental constraints could enhance rather than just inhibit adaptive evolution by natural selection. This paper was critical in the synthesis of structuralist and functionalist approaches to the study of form, and made the concept of developmental constraint more accessible to hardcore Darwinians. Note the structure of the corridor models of adaptation.

	24. Hall, B. K. (1998) - The first assigned part extends the notion of developmental constraint to the concept of a Bauplan, a highly controversial structuralist explanation of the morphological differences among higher taxa. The second chapter introduces the important concept of genetic assimilation, which illustrates the plasticity of the relationship between genotype and phenotype (explored in depth in the following topics). Note that the electronic reserve includes two complete chapters but that only parts of these chapters are assigned.


E. Epigenetic Mechanisms, Modularity and Evolvability

	25. Alberch, P (1991) – The conceptual transition from developmental constraint to evolvability is the main reason for assigning this paper.

	26. Newman, S. A. and G. B. Müller (2000) - Genetic machinery is considered an evolved set of constraints on the realization of forms made possible by the intrinsic properties of biological materials. The causal connections between genotype and phenotype are elaborated and in some ways reversed from conventional treatments. This is one of the most challenging and perhaps useful modifications of evolutionary theory to emerge from evolutionary developmental biology.

	27. Hansen (2006) – The concept of genetic architecture and its evolution is important both to issues of evolvability (the current topic) and speciation by genetic transilience (topic V. J.). This is a precise and thoughtful treatment. Careful attention to the main concepts of this paper will be rewarded in upcoming topics.

	28. Wagner, G. P., M. Pavlicev and J. M. Cheverud (2007) – A thoughtful and important coverage of the critical concept of modularity in evolution. Modularity is one of the key concepts underlying a proposed extended evolutionary synthesis to incorporate development and morphology into evolutionary theory.

	29. Carroll, S. B. (2008) – A good summary of the contributions of evolutionary developmental biology to an expanded evolutionary theory. Note specifically this author’s emphasis on cis-regulation at the level of gene expression, a claim that has generated controversy. The author is a very influential evolutionary biologist and a former Washington University undergraduate.

	30. Wagner, A. (2008) – The critical concepts of evolvability and robustness, and their relationships to each other at different hierarchical levels, are explored precisely and critically. This is a relatively tedious paper, but its insights reward careful reading.

---
37. Hoekstra, H. E., Coyne, J. A. (2007) - A review of the evidence for the importance of cis-regulatory regions in creating morphological evolution by prominent evolutionary geneticists. They discuss the role of modularity, pleitropic effects in speciation and evolution generally. They note papers at the end that come to opposite conclusions.

38. Wagner, G. P., Altenberg, L. (1996) - A very interesting and thought provoking paper on evolvability, evo-devo, and computational biology. Lee Altenberg is a theoretical biologist at UH in ICS.



F. Evolutionary Novelties: Origins and Evolutionary Consequences

31. Cracraft, J. (1990) - Cracraft criticizes the concept of evolutionary innovation and the proposed roles of novel features in evolutionary diversification. He presents a protocol for comparative study of evolutionary novelties. Useful comparisons can be made between this paper and reading #7. Cracraft's critique warns evolutionists that origin of a novelty is not sufficient to predict high rates of speciation and ecological diversification in the subsequent evolution of a population.

32. Galis, F. (2001) - Here is a good review of uses of "key innovation" in evolution, including criticism of some widespread misuses.

33. Fürsich, F. T. and D. Jablonski (1984) - In the spirit of readings #31-32, this paper shows that a "key innovation" does not inevitably lead to adaptive diversification, evolutionary success or extensive speciation. Does this paper effectively answer the criticism that a key innovation can be identified only in the context of adaptive diversification and not independently?

34. Jablonski, D. (2005) - influential work suggesting that evolutionary novelties associated with origins of higher taxa occur preferentially in highly disturbed environments in the marine fossil record. Cracraft (1990) is highly critical of these arguments.


G. Evolution of Adaptation

35. Lewontin, R. (1977) - a classic criticism of adaptationist studies, especially as used in sociobiology.

36. Ellstrand, N. E. (1983) - an interesting critique of adaptationism from an unusual angle, and one of my favorites.

37. Larson, A. (2009) – Note the important distinctions between adaptation, exaptation, nonaptation, and disaptation (primary and secondary). A critical message is that evaluating the evolutionary relationships between character origin and utility requires an explicitly historical context and robust hypotheses of homology. I use more microevolutionary examples than I did in earlier writings on adaptation because the paper was written for an ecological volume, but the historical contingency of adaptation and alternative concepts is the same in both microevolutionary and macroevolutionary comparisons.

38. Agosta, S. J. and A. E. Dunham (2004) - an interchange with the authors of reading #39 regarding use of phylogenetic criteria in adaptive interpretations.

39. Brodie, E. D. III, K. V. Young and E. D. Brodie Jr. (2004) - a response to the criticisms of reading #38.


H. Alternative Adaptations

40. West-Eberhard, M. J. (1986) - an often ignored but important hypothesis that evolutionary divergence between alternative characters often precedes rather than follows evolutionary divergence of the populations containing those characters. Evolutionary theory is generally constructed with the opposite assumption, and this paper at least makes us acknowledge that assumption. This thesis was expanded into a book-length treatment of evolutionary plasticity by the author in 2003 (source of reading #19).

	41. Liem, K. F. and L. S. Kaufman (1984) - one of the best examples meeting the criteria of West-Eberhard's "alternative adaptations," and a dramatic case of a population maintaining polymorphism for alternative characters whose divergence approaches macroevolutionary proportions.

	42. Sinervo, B. and E. I. Svensson (2004) - This paper presents a nice, concise synthesis of the phenomenon of "alternative adaptations," morphological novelty, and speciation, although it does not cite West-Eberhard's work directly.

	43. West-Eberhard, M. J. (2005) - a reassessment of the role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptive evolution. Have the concepts developed by evolutionary developmental biologists following her earlier paper (reading #40) caused important changes in her thinking on this issue?


V. Species and Speciation

A. Essentialism, Typology and the Biological Species Concept

	44. Mayr, E. (1987) - The philosophical question of whether species are classes, individuals or populations is an important one affecting all concepts of species and evolutionary theory in general (punctuated equilibrium and the hierarchical expansion of selection theory rely on the argument that species are individuals, for example). Mayr presents a clear coverage of this issue, and defends his biological species concept against criticism in this important paper. Ultimately, the issue was refined by the “general lineage concept” in which species are segments of population lineages (see de Quieroz 1999).

B. The Recognition Concept of Species

	45. Paterson, H. E. H. (1985) - a critique of the biological species concept emphasizing the species as a philosophical individual and important level of complexity in the genealogical hierarchy of life. This concept involves strong criticism of nonallopatric mechanisms for formation of species.

C. The Evolutionary Species Concept

	46. Wiley, E. O. (1981) - an update of Simpson's evolutionary species concept, which explicitly defines species as having a temporal dimension. It is often called a "lineage concept" of species to distinguish it from concepts that consider species only at a single moment in time (biological and recognition concepts, for example), although this distinction is debated (see de Quieroz 1999).

D. The Cohesion Concept of Species

	47. Templeton, A. R. (1989) - a revision of the evolutionary species concept designed to make population genetic principles more explicit conceptually and to provide greater testability.

E. The Phylogenetic Concept of Species

	48. Cracraft, J. (1989) - a concept designed to be optimal for reconstructing the phylogenetic history of life in the finest possible detail, especially with respect to biogeographical and conservational issues. This concept has gained numerous followers, who nonetheless have numerous disagreements among themselves regarding criteria of diagnosability. This paper is probably the most thorough general statement of the phylogenetic species concept.

F. The Genetic Concept of Species

	49. Baker, R. J. and R. D. Bradley (2006) - a concept that preserves many goals of the phylogenetic species concept but which explicitly acknowledges population genetic studies of haplotype variation for multiple loci.

G. The General Lineage Concept of Species

	50. de Queiroz, K. (1999) - an ambitious attempt to place all of the preceding concepts into a common conceptual framework recognizing important contributions from all of the concepts. Many recent papers invoke this concept as the basis for discussions of species and speciation. I interpret the argument basically as a statement that the ontological status of a species is a segment of a population lineage.

H. Spatial Dynamics of Speciation

	51. Cracraft, J. (1983) - For a concise statement of the principles of vicariance biogeography, this paper remains my favorite. It clearly shows the importance of using a phylogenetic species concept for understanding the biogeographic history of a group. Empirical data collected by Cracraft and many others eventually rejected the utility of general area cladograms and therefore of the vicariance biogeographic paradigm, although vicariance as a process remains critically important in historical biogeography.

	52. Dillon, S. and J. Fjeldså (2005) - a comparative study of the utilities of the biological and phylogenetic species concepts for assessing spatial patterns of differentiation in birds, which are the best-characterized animal taxon.

	53. Heaney, L. R. (2007) - synthesizes new findings that many vertebrate groups comprise a network of cryptic species lineages that replace each other geographically. Continental and island forms are more similar in their overall patterns of spatial fragmentation than formerly suspected.

	54. Genner, M. J., P. Nichols, G. Carvalho, R. L. Robinson, P. W. Shaw, A. Smith, and G. F. Turner (2007) - A study illustrating the traditional "peripatric" speciation mode of Mayr, which inspired the theory of punctuated equilibrium. This paper is important for several issues covered in the next topic, "modes of speciation."

	55. Kozak, K. H., D. W. Weisrock and A. Larson (2006) - a quantification of rates of lineage accumulation across geographic space shows that vicariance and preemptive occupation of space can produce speciation rates that rival those of "adaptive radiations" without producing extensive ecological disparity among lineages. Compare this approach to the criticisms of reading #31.

I. Modes of Speciation

	56. Gavrilets, S. (2004) - An overview of modes of speciation as used in contemporary discussions of fitness landscapes and their role in speciation (see reading #60).

	57. Paterson, H. E. H. (1981) - The title is pessimistic, but the paper makes a compelling argument that allopatric speciation is the only geographic mode for which evidence is convincing. Have the past 29 years of research in this area refuted Paterson's major claims? (compare to reading #59)

	58. Templeton, A. (1981) - categorizes modes of speciation explicitly on population-genetic criteria rather than geographic ones. This scheme has not replaced use of geographic categories to describe modes of speciation, but it makes important conceptual distinctions that are overlooked by the standard geographic categorizations.

	59. Coyne, J. A. (2007) - a good review of the empirical problems raised by the notion of sympatric speciation. Compare this discussion to the results of reading #56.

J. Adaptive Landscapes and Speciation

	60. Skipper, R. A. Jr. (2004) - a thoughtful discussion of Wright's shifting-balance process and interpretation of Wright's graphic depiction of this process. Concepts discussed here are useful in understanding concepts of genetic divergence versus transilience as presented in the following papers.

	61. Carson, H. L. and A. R. Templeton (1984) - after many years, still my favorite paper on the issue of founder-induced speciation as a population genetic process. Compare to reading #30 for updates on the issue of genetic architecture.

	62. Templeton, A. R. (1996) - an insightful review of experimental evidence testing predictions of founder-flush and genetic transilience models of founder-induced speciation.

	63. Gavrilets, S. (1999) - a reassessment of multidimensional adaptive landscapes arguing that populations do not need to pass through unstable nonadaptive conditions to make transitions between alternative fitness peaks. Read this paper for its main message regarding this claim; details of the mathematical models are beyond the scope of the class. Are empirical findings consistent with the notion that populations never pass through adaptive valleys when undergoing evolutionary transitions to new adaptive peaks?

VI. Tempo and Mode of Speciation and Morphological Evolution - Punctuated Equilibrium versus Phyletic Evolution

	64. Gould, S. J. (2001) - a good explanation of punctuated equilibrium by a strong advocate.

	65. Turner, J. R. G. (1988) - an important critique of punctuated equilibrium that accepts some but not all of its claims. He argues for "punctuated phyletic evolution," an alternative to the contrasting hypotheses of phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium. His arguments are addressed in #64, but I do not find Gould's refutation of this criticism convincing.

	66. Jackson, J. B. C. and A. H. Cheetham (1999) - A review of paleontological tests of punctuated equilibrium by authors whose work is considered the strongest empirical demonstration of punctuated equilibrium.

	67. Eldredge N., J. N. Thompson, P. M. Brakefield, S. Gavrilets, D. Jablonski, J. B. C. Jackson, R. E. Lenski, B. S. Lieberman, M. A. McPeek and W. Miller, III (2005) - An assessment of the mechanistic basis of species stasis as formulated by the theory of punctuated equilibrium.

	68. Levinton, J. S. (2001) - A well-argued criticism of punctuated equilibrium by an evolutionary paleontologist who is one of Gould's strongest critics. If there is a fatal flaw in the theory of punctuated equilibrium, Levinton will have found it.

VII. Hierarchy of Sorting and Selection

A. General Theory

	69. Gould, S. J. (1985) - an excellent paper arguing for the temporal discontinuity of evolutionary processes. I have problems with Gould's use of evolutionary progress, and I find his description of the evolutionary timescales a bit too rigid; however, it is still one of my favorite papers.

	70. Vrba, E. S. and S. J. Gould (1986) - The distinction between sorting and selection is long overdue and extremely important. The structure of the hierarchically expanded theory of selection is covered thoroughly. An expanded concept of individuality is very important here. Like #69, this is among the most important papers covered in the class.

	71. Lieberman, B. S. and E. S. Vrba (2005) - an explanation of changing ideas on the contentious issue of species selection.

	72. Gould, S. J. (1995) - We now complete the article assigned originally as #3 to understand the hierarchically expanded Darwinian theory of evolution. Gould's 2002 book (excerpted in #73) is devoted to this issue.

	73. Gould, S. J. (2002) - This excerpt from Gould's 2002 book expands the general ideas presented in #70-72, with a very helpful summary table. The concept of evolutionary drive is developed more explicitly here than in Gould's earlier writings on hierarchical expansion of evolutionary theory.

B. Challenges to the Paradox of the First Tier

	74. Kitchell, J. A. (1990) - a sophisticated attempt to evaluate evolutionary trends in predator/prey coevolution using coupled differential equations. The hypothesis that directional trends are predicted from Darwinian natural selection is strongly attacked. If she is correct, Gould's argument that first-tier processes predict progress is refuted. Do Kitchell's mathematical models lead us to greater understanding or to scientific paralysis?

	75. Jackson, J. B. C. and F. McKinney (1990) - Can second-tier processes be a source of progressive macroevolutionary trends? What are the implications of such findings for the arguments of readings #71 and 76?

	76. McCune, A. R., K. S. Thomson and P. E. Olsen (1984) - This example is a favorite one illustrating opposition between evolutionary processes acting at different tiers of evolutionary time. The conflicts occur between what are essentially the second and third tiers discussed in paper 72, but the timescale involved is greatly compressed relative to the expected occurrence of species selection and catastrophic species selection.

	77. Lieberman, B. S. (1995) - Here is some empirical work testing hypotheses of hierarchical evolutionary processes.


VIII. Extinction

A. Taxonomic Survivorship Curves

	78. Van Valen, L. (1973) - Few papers have been both as influential and as controversial as this one has been. The methodology of this paper relies on evolutionary taxonomy and presents a discovery that would not have been made using cladistic taxonomy. Cladists almost universally discredit this work. It gave us the "Red Queen's hypothesis" of evolution, which has had pervasive influence. This paper launched a highly idiosyncratic evolutionary journal, dedicated to the primacy of content over display.

	79. McCune, A. R. (1982) - This paper notes important ambiguities in the interpretation of reading #81 and discusses the importance of these results for hierarchical selection theory. Is the Red Queen's hypothesis actually supported by these results?

	80. Foote, M. (2001) - I consider this paper the most thorough explanation of Van Valen's results and their real message for macroevolution.

B. Periodicity of Extinction

	81. Raup, D. M. and J. J. Sepkoski, Jr. (1984) - In the Simpsonian tradition, statistical studies of taxic diversity in the post-Paleozoic marine fossil record suggest a periodicity of mass extinctions. This paper is a classic and one generally disliked by cladistic systematists (#82). The claim for periodicity of extinction peaks is probably not widely accepted today, but the issues resulting from this analysis have important implications for the more general issue of using Simpsonian higher taxa as units of analysis in studies of extinction (see readings 82 and 83).

	82. Patterson, C. and A. B. Smith (1987) - presents the major cladistic arguments against the claims of #81.

	83. Sepkoski, J. J., Jr. and D. C. Kendrick (1993) - Numerical methods indicate that Simpsonian higher taxa may serve as valid sampling units for measuring extinction rates of species lineages in the fossil record. Does this result confirm the validity of Simpsonian evolutionary taxonomy?

C. Evolutionary Consequences of Episodic Extinction Peaks

	84. Alvarez, W. (1986) - This paper describes the author's highly influential work showing that asteroid impacts may explain a mass extinction at the K-T boundary. It also discusses periodicity of mass extinctions (#81) and the associated "death star" hypothesis. This is the work that most directly inspired thinking about Gould's tier 3 of evolutionary time as a source of novel selective processes.

	85. Raup, D. M. (1995) - This influential paleontologist argues that our current knowledge of extinction gives it an important role in evolution not anticipated by Darwin and Simpson. Incorporation of this extinction theory is one of the most important revisions of Darwinian evolutionary theory. Demonstration of episodic extinction peaks using the "kill curve" is more widely accepted than the argument for periodicity of extinctions argued in reading #81.

	86. Jablonski D. (2005) - an update on extinction peaks in evolution by a leading worker in this field.

IX. Diversity Through Time

A. Taxonomic Diversity Versus Disparity

	87. Gould, S. J. (1991) - Controversy over interpretation of the Burgess Shale arthropod fauna leads to an important distinction between morphological diversity and morphological disparity. The question of how to measure these factors is a highly debated topic and the subject of numerous recent papers.

	88. Briggs, D. E. G., R. A. Fortey and M. A. Wills (1992) - These authors present an empirical refutation of Gould's interpretation of the Burgess Shale arthropod fauna using two different methods for quantifying morphospace. Are these authors successful in quantifying the relevant parameters and thereby refuting Gould's arguments?

	89. Briggs, D. E. G. and R. A. Fortey (2005) - an update on the continuing problem of how to interpret the "Cambrian explosion."

	90. Foote, M. (1993) - A classic paper showing the methodology for comparing taxonomic diversity versus disparity through time and giving predictions of hierarchical evolutionary hypotheses regarding the macroevolutionary relationship between these parameters. Many studies conducted in this manner have followed.

B. Birth-Death Models and “Clade Shapes”

	91. Nee, S. (2006) – reviews models that have been applied both to fossil data and phylogenies constructed from extant species to measure lineage accumulation and diversity through time. These approaches were applied, for example, in reading #55.

C. Phanerozoic Diversity

	92. Sepkoski, J. J., Jr. (1981) - a classic paper of evolutionary paleontology, implementing Simpson's taxic approach to examine biological diversity through time in the marine fossil record. The three great faunas identified by Sepkoski's factor analysis are a major concept of evolutionary paleontology. It is one of the most influential macroevolutionary meta-analyses.

	93. Stanley, S. K. (2007) - a thorough reevaluation of the phenomena of reading #92 using the most current analytical methods. This is perhaps the most thorough statistical description available of Phanerozoic macroevolutionary patterns and processes.
