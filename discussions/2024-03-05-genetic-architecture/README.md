The concept of genetic architecture and its evolution is important both to issues of evolvability (the next topic) and speciation by genetic transilience. This is a precise and thoughtful treatment. Careful attention to the main concepts of this paper will be rewarded in upcoming topics.

A thoughtful and important coverage of the critical concept of modularity in evolution. Modularity is one of the key concepts underlying a proposed extended evolutionary synthesis to incorporate development and morphology into evolutionary theory.
