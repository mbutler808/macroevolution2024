### 25. [Carroll, S. B. 2008](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ocqMPD5gX9xi4VQy_5OtU5wSyg-X8ftM) Evo-devo and an expanding evolutionary synthesis: a genetic theory of morphological evolution. Cell 134:25-36.  **map:Danny**

A good summary of the contributions of evolutionary developmental biology to an expanded evolutionary theory. Note specifically this authorâ€™s emphasis on cis-regulation at the level of gene expression, a claim that has generated controversy. The author is a very influential evolutionary biologist and a former Washington University undergraduate.
