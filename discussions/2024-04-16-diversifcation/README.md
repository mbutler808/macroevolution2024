## Diversity through time  


49. [Nee, S. 2006](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ocqMPD5gX9xi4VQy_5OtU5wSyg-X8ftM) Birth-death models in macroevolution. Ann. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 37:1-17. DOI: 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110035

#### Questions

1. What are some hypotheses (or your own speculations) for the remarkably high speciation rate of Hawaiian silverswords?

2. At the top of p. 7, Nee indicates that we would expect the future lifetime of a species to be independent of how long it has been around already. Do you agree with this and why or why not?

#### Questions

1. What sorts of characters might increase rate of speciation? Extinction?

2. What are some of the limitations of this method?
