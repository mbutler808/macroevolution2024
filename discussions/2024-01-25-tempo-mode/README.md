### Stephen Jay Gould

* Paleontolgist, Harvard/NYU, 1941 - 2002  
* Prolific writer, many popular writings that popularized evolutionary biology  
  * Scientific contributions - most important "Punctuated Equilibrium" with Niles Eldridge  
  * Book: Ontogeny and Phylogeny 1977 idea: Ernst Haekelʻs "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"   
  * Popular books: "The Pandaʻs Thumb", "Henʻs Teeth and Horseʻs Toes", "Wonderful Life: the Burgess shale and the nature of history"  
  * Final masterpiece: "The Structure of Evolutionary Theory" 2002  

### George Gaylord Simpson

* Paleontologist
* *Tempo and Mode in Evolution* major contribution to the Synthesis

The "Modern Synthesis" or the birth of Neo-Darwinism was the reinterpretation of Darwinʻs theories in the light of geentics.  
Two stages of development:
1) Population Genetic Core in 1920ʻs-30ʻs by RA Fisher, Sewell Wright, and JBS Haldane
  * very mathematical
2) Alignment with more traditional disciplines including Natural History: Dobzhansky (genetics) 1937, Mayr (systematics) 1942, Simpson (paleontology) 1944, Stebbins (botany) 1950
  * **only Simpson had mathematical background to understand Pop Gen core**
