## Hybridization

Is hybridization a destructive or a cohesive or force in evolution? On the one hand, hybridizing species may not be able to maintain distinct gene pools, merging into a single reticulate species (after all, the very idea that genetic "segregation" is what is responsible for the creation of new species is the definition of the Biological Species Concept). On the other hand, there are examples of hybrid zones that are stable and persistent. Why are they stable? Are they sources of genetic variation as genes cross species? Recently researchers have proposed ancient hybrid origins of adaptive radiation. The plot thickens.
