An important paper showing that the standard categorization of heterochronic patterns and processes (Galis 2001) is difficult to apply to early ontogeny and/or between hierarchical levels (organismal morphology versus gene expression).

The first paper to show that developmental constraints could enhance rather than just inhibit adaptive evolution by natural selection. This paper was critical in the synthesis of structuralist and functionalist approaches to the study of form, and made the concept of developmental constraint more accessible to hardcore Darwinians. Note the structure of the corridor models of adaptation.
