###   13. [Patterson, C. 1982](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ocqMPD5gX9xi4VQy_5OtU5wSyg-X8ftM). Morphological characters and homology. Pp. 21-74 in K. A. Joysey and A. E. Friday (eds.) Problems of Phylogenetic Reconstruction. Academic Press, New York.   

   This is the most influential writing on the subject of taxic homology since a rebirth of interest in morphological characters and homology in the early 1980s. Patterson's review of the three tests of homology and how they distinguish homology from alternative relationships among characters is extensively used and cited. His decision to equate homology with synapomorphy remains controversial. The important theme of ontogeny and phylogeny as introduced here is a major theme of the course. This paper is also an argument for a taxonomic philosophy called "pattern cladism," which denies the claim that evolutionary theory should be the basis of phylogenetic systematics. Patterson builds his argument for pattern cladism from Karl Popper's philosophical principles of hypothetico-deductivism, which he abuses (see reading #12). This paper and the next one are among the most tedious ones in the course; working through them is useful, however, for getting a thorough understanding of morphological homology. Patterson's tests are also the basis for distinguishing different kinds of molecular homology.

   A critique of pattern cladism showing the conceptual problems of Patterson's scheme. I agree with this criticism and with the argument that phylogenetic systematics should be based explicitly on Darwin's theory of common descent. The novel character concept presented here is insightful, although few morphological systematists have implemented it (not even the author). This paper, like #11, is tedious reading but provides a thorough understanding of morphological characters in systematics and the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny. Its insights reward a careful reading.
