Exploration of the hierarchical structure of homology, including the relationship between morphological homology and the structures of genetic systems. Pay close attention to the meanings of character identity networks (ChINs) and gene regulatory networks (GRNs).

A classic paper giving formal definitions of the standard patterns and processes of heterochrony, especially as relevant to changes occurring relatively late in ontogeny (retroactively termed "de Beerian heterochrony" by many authors). This is the standard scheme against which others are compared.
