## Phylogenetic approaches to biogeography

The spatial history of a group has long been an interest of evolutionary biologists, especially when we are interested in speciation, diversification, and patterns of biodiversity. In fact, biological evidence was a strong justification for the theory of plate tectonics. Today geology and evolutionary biology are mutually reinforcing sources of information to understand how things came to be. From purely descriptive arguments for biogeograhical sequences, the first methods were cladistic, later explicit mathematical models were applied to spatial occurrence data within the context of phylogeny.

Ree and Smith 2008 made a big spash with a maximum likelihood method (Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis or DEC models) to describe the evolution of geographic ranges across a phylogeny. Bayesian implementation of this and related methods quickly followed.

Phylogenetic inference of where species spread or split across barriers. *PNAS* 119:e2116948119 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2116948119 

Landis and colleagues demonstrate the use of the geographic range evoution models along with GeoSSE models to study hypotheses of geographic barriers that lead to evolution by vicariance. They also include additional hypotheses that can influence diversifcation and show how to compare the hypotheses in a modern statistical model-comparison framework.

### 57. [Losos, J.B., Ricklefs, R.E. 2009](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ocqMPD5gX9xi4VQy_5OtU5wSyg-X8ftM) Adaptation and diversification on islands. Nature 457:830-836 doi:10.1038/nature07893  **map:Rai**  

Losos and Ricklefs wrote this very interesting paper on Darwin ªs bicenntenial. They explored the roles of contingency and determinism in the diversification of species, and the special roles that islands may play (adding in ideas of island biogeography).
