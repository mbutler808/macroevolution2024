# Exam 3
## Due: May 7, 2024 10:30am-12:30pm

Last one! You made it!!

### Instructions
This exam will be in person during the final exam period on May 7 from 10:30am-12:30pm. You may verbally discuss questions with each other in real time (in person, phone, or video chat), but you must not share written answers (no texting, messaging, email, etc.). You may not discuss with others outside of this class, and all answers must be your own work.

Please answer the questions focusing on your ideas. I am interested in your arguments - what positions are you taking, and what evidence is it based on? For evidence you should refer to the readings. Your grade will not be determined by whether I agree or disagree with your argument, but rather if it is well-supported and well-argued. Scientists do have all kinds of views, so it comes down to whether your position is a reasonable interpretation of the facts.

Having learned from the previous exams, please dig deep. Be precise, not vague. Show me that you have really read the papers by referring to the relevant, critical details needed to distinguish positions or arguments. No need to explain the very basics, assume that I have read the papers too. You are writing to evolutionary biologists, not the general public. I understand that it ªs sometimes hard to figure out how much background to provide. As a rule -- your **background**, if you must have some, should be very short in comparison to the main body of your answer.

Please try to be concise, but content is more important than style. The primacy of content means that long irrelevant answers will also hurt your grade, but so will missing major points. Make sure you hit all the important points, after that, work on being concise and direct - it is more impactful (think of it as a strong content/fluff ratio).

Also remember to avoid a checklist style. Instead try to write a holistic answer with a thesis (i.e., your position on the question). The prompts are intended to guide you to a complete answer. Cover as much as you can in a cohesive answer.

Please answer three of the four questions. I can't wait to read your answers! Best of luck, brilliant young evolutionary biologists.

### Questions

1. Now that we have some clues that hybridization may be more common than previously thought, which species concepts (or aspects of concepts) would be useful in studying diversity in groups that may have a hybrid origin (such as the parrotfish [Schwartz et al., 2012], African cichlids [e.g., Brawand et al., 2014], or hybridizing plants [e.g., Wendel et al., 2000 or other readings], take your pick)? Define the key components of each species concept (at least 3 species concepts). Now think about what is important to describe in the biological process of speciation, versus the diagnosing of species that already exist? How useful are the species concepts in advancing these aims? Do any of the systems provide data to actually understand if the proposed biological mechanisms are actually occurring? Bonus - how would any of this apply to *species boundaries* and how they are maintained?

2. How do modern methods of phylogenetic inference differ from building phylogenies using phenetic or cladistic methods? Compare and contrast Maximum Likelihood and/or Bayesian Inference methods with the older methods. Are the notions of homology and synapomorphy still relevant? Important? Details please. What types of data are used in each? What does the model of evolution in ML and BI methods add in terms of describing evolutionary history (is the resulting phylogeny better? how? more detailed? explain), and why are these models not possible in phenetic or cladistic methods? Is there any situation where phenetic or cladistic methods are expected to be equal to or outperform ML or BI methods? 

3. What would you recommend in designing a program to study adaptation? When trying to demonstrate that a phenotype is evolving in response to selection, what is the importance of demonstrating that evolutionary changes: result in improvement in function, result in increasing fitness, are ecologically relevant; and to do so within a phylogenetic context. Refer to any critiques or literature we read. Discuss what at least 3 of the following authors have contributed to this aim: Galis 2001, Jablonski 2005, Arnold 1983, Felsenstein 1985, Losos 1990, Butler and King 2004. Does their work answer "adaptationist" critiques, if so how? Do you believe that demonstrating convergence is necessary to demonstrate adaptation?

4. Your own question. Dig deep and explore. Lots of potential here - for example, maybe explaining rates of evolution? Is it possible to now reconcile "gradualism" with "punctuated evolution" given what we know now?  Go wild, wow me :).
