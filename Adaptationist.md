Wicked (Satirical) Critiques of Adaptation

By the late 70ʻs, early 80ʻs there were some rather sharp criticisms of the "Adaptationist" program. Two particularly influential criticisms were:

Gould and Lewontin (1979) which provided a vivid image of the "adaptationist program" through the character of Dr. Pangloss: "Things cannot be other than they are... Everything is made for the best purpose. Our noses were made to carry spectacles, so we have spectacles..."  Lol.


The other paper was Ellstrand (1983). Enjoy the (snarky) and satirical read, which is actually a very thorough and scholarly run through of many hypotheses in ecology and evolution. In less than 2 pages, he perfectly illustrates a logical flaw that some studies fall victim to.  Wait for it -- the last line.  After this, being called "an adaptationist" was a pretty bad insult.

Watch for these concepts:
1. Falsifiability
2. Circularity
3. Causation
